<h2>Changes I Made 😁</h2>
<br>-- Made it mobile responsive because the code in the course is only focusing on javscript and their game is not responsive.
<br>-- Added accessibility like press enter to submit.
<br>-- Added simple css animation keyframes

<h2>How to play ❓</h2>

Goal of the game is to find the mystery or unknown digit which is random between 1 to 20 <br>
At each guess you will be given a hint like too low or too high <br>
Each guess will take 1 out of your score so you can set highscore by getting the number in less guesses

I Made this javascript game while completing a course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
